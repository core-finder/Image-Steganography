# Image-Steganography
Image Steganography is a technique used to hide secret information or messages within an image without changing its visual appearance significantly. It is a form of data hiding that aims to achieve confidentiality and secrecy by embedding data into the image's pixels.

This project utilizes the fundamental capabilities of the steganography.js JavaScript library to implement image steganography. The features I have used include:

Image Selection: Users can upload an image file of their choice for steganography. Text Input: Users can enter the text message they want to hide within the image. Hide Functionality: The "Hide" button triggers the encoding process, where the text message is embedded within the image's pixels. Read Functionality: The "Read" button extracts the hidden text message from the encoded image. Capacity Display: The capacity of the image to hide text is dynamically calculated and displayed as "(current length/total capacity)". Encoded Image Display: The plain image and the encoded image are displayed side by side for comparison. Download Encoded Image: Users can download the encoded image file for further use. Message Display: The hidden text message is displayed on the screen once it is extracted from the encoded image. Copy Text: Users can copy the extracted text message to the clipboard with the "Copy Text" button. Popup Message: After the text is hidden in the image, a popup message appears to indicate that the message is hidden successfully.

These features provide a user-friendly interface for concealing and retrieving messages within images, making the process quick and effortless.

Overall, This project showcases the power and practical applications of image steganography using JavaScript and the steganography.js library.
